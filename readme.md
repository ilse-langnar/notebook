Imagine [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) + [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) + [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/) + [Supermemo](https://www.supermemopedia.com/wiki/Main_Page) but without their downsides such as online-only, lock-in, bad algorithm, complexity etc.

Ilse aims to be the ultimate study and note-taking tool by learning from its predecessors and building something that last by implementing a standard instead of building just software which might [rot overtime]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot).

Try the online [Demo](https://ilse-langnar.github.io/notebook/demo/index.html) or download it form [Linux](https://github.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/releases/download/0.8/ilse-langnar-notebook-0.1.8.AppImage) [Windows](https://github.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/releases/download/0.8/ilse-langnar-notebook-0.1.8.AppImage) or [OS x]().

If anything goes wrong, please open a [Issue](https://github.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/issues/new).

## Why
To augment human cognition with memory, references and more.
Ilse is based on the Vitruvian Brain Framework: https://ilse-langnar.github.io/notebook/vitruvian-brain.html

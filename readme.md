<h4 align="center" > Ilse Langnar's Notebook is a free, knowledge management platform. </h4>

Imagine [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) + [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) + [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/) + [Supermemo](https://www.supermemopedia.com/wiki/Main_Page) + [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) + [Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/) but without their downsides such as online-only, lock-in, bad algorithm, complexity etc.


Ilse aims to be the ultimate study and note-taking tool by learning from its predecessors and building something that last by implementing a standard instead of building just software which might [rot overtime]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot). And this standard is called [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML).

Try the online [Demo](https://ilse-langnar.github.io/notebook/demo/index.html) or download it form [Linux](https://github.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/releases/download/0.8/ilse-langnar-notebook-0.1.8.AppImage) [Windows](https://github.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/releases/download/0.8/ilse-langnar-notebook-0.1.8.AppImage) or [OS x]().

If anything goes wrong, please open a [Issue](https://github.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/issues/new).

<h2 align="center" > Why  </h2>
To augment human cognition with memory, references and tools.

This software is made with the intent of lasting century, this is because it's based on 2 thing: Plain Text & HTML.
So as long you have a program that can interpret text and HTML, you data will still be ok.

This program defines a couple of base "features" that be combined with each other to form generative tools for thought, so Ilse is the base, and then you "evolve" the system as you wish to use it.

|--------------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | You import a wikipedia article on: Alcohol, and you see a table with a bunch of alcohols and how to name them: | ![Alcohols](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/dev/docs/all-alcohols.png) |
| 2 | You take screenshot of the first alcohol | ![First Alcohol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/dev/docs/alcohol.png) |
| 3 | You take screenshot of the second alcohol | ![Second Alcohol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/dev/docs/alcohol-1.png) |
| 4 | You take screenshot of the third alcohol | ![Third Alcohol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/dev/docs/alcohol-2.png) |
| 5 | You take screenshot of the Fourth alcohol | ![Fourth Alcohol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/dev/docs/alcohol-3.png) |
| 6 | After taking a screenshot of each item, each one of them will be "queued" differently based on your memory, thus the schedule for each item will be different based on how well you remember the alcohol, allowing you to "chunk" this knowledge about alcohols | |

    | Way         | Explanation     | Value |
    |--------------|-----------|------------|
    | Opening an issue    | If you have a question or something is wrong, you can [open a issue](https://github.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/issues/new)  so we can figure itt out. | Medium |
    | Help with translation | You can help translate ilse into another language such as: `Chinese Simplified(简体中文) Brazillian Portuguese(Português Brasileiro) Spanish(Español) Korean(한국어) japanese(日本人) Dutch(Nederlands) Hebrew (עברית) French (français) Italian (italiano) Greek (Ελληνικά) Arabic (عربى) Russian (русский) Polish (Polskie) German(Deutsche)` go to [Here](https://github.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/issues/new) edit the file with the ISO code for the language, translate it, then add push so I can add it the `dev` branch and then to a more stable branch. | Medium |
    | Donate Money| I'll work much harder and focused if I don't have to worry about my expenses thus making the project progress at a much faster rate. | High |
    | Become a tester |  If you have a "niche" device please join as a tester to test the stability in different platforms(Blackberry, BDS?, MacOS, Linux Distros, Older Windows ). | High |
    | Make a `command` |  A command is a executable piece of code encapsulated into a name, they're very good for speed! | Low |
    | Make a `CSS Snippet` | CSS snippets fix little style errores where a full theme would be unecessary, use: "#i/css \`\`\`css html, body { background: red; }\`\`\`. | Low |
    | Make a `Theme` |  A theme is like a bunch of css snippets but they relate to each other to form a more "grand" structure, use this template to create themes:  [Theme Template](https://github.com/ilse-langnar/theme-template). | Medium |
    | Make a `Plugin` |  A plugin is where you actually extend ilse with more components, commands and functionality, make plugins using:  [Plugin Template](https://github.com/ilse-langnar/plugin-template). | High |

    | Make `Flashcards`  | Create a project with the sturcture like: [Flashcards Template](https://github.com/ilse-langnar/flashcards-template). and fill it with your item. | Medium |
    | Make Memes | Help spread the tool with virality and easy-to-consume memes. | High |
    | Join Discord | I'll post updates, ideas, plugins, themes, snippets, commands screenshots and more. https://discord.gg/9BVx8YHr | Medium |
    | Fix a bug yourself | Modify the code and then do a push into the `dev` branch, I'll later move it to more stable branches. | High |
    | Become smarter| That's the final goal here, the final goal is better thinking. | Inifinity |

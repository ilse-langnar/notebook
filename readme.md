<h4 align="center" > Ilse Langnar's Notebook is a free, knowledge management platform. </h4>
<br/>

Imagine Roam Research + Obsidian + Anki + Supermemo but without their downsides such as online-only, lock-in, bad algorithm, complexity etc.
Ilse aims to be the ultimate study and note-taking tool by learning from its predecessors and building something that last by implementing a standard instead of building just software which might [rot overtime]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot).

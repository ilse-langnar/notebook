Imagine [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) + [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) + [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/) + [Supermemo](https://www.supermemopedia.com/wiki/Main_Page) but without their downsides such as online-only, lock-in, bad algorithm, complexity etc.

Ilse aims to be the ultimate study and note-taking tool by learning from its predecessors and building something that last by implementing a standard instead of building just software which might [rot overtime]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot).

Try the online [Demo](https://ilse-langnar.github.io/notebook/demo/index.html) or download it form [Linux](https://github.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/releases/download/0.8/ilse-langnar-notebook-0.1.8.AppImage) [Windows](https://github.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/releases/download/0.8/ilse-langnar-notebook-0.1.8.AppImage) or [OS x]().

If anything goes wrong, please open a [Issue](https://github.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/issues/new).

## Why
To augment human cognition with memory, references and more.
Ilse is based on the Vitruvian Brain Framework: https://ilse-langnar.github.io/notebook/vitruvian-brain.html
We avoid any type of lock-in due to the fact that a simple set of files and folder is able to reproduce the entire system, which means that with a simple standardized format can be visualized in multiple ways like: __Mind Maps__, __Tree__, __Infinite Canvas__, __Spreadsheet__, and more.
And given that the format is standardized, if someone finds a new way of reprensenting data, we would simply have to write a plugin that representes those already standardized into the desired new format(presentation).
This way we avoid anye sort of proprietary binary format for organization and visualization, even if the software rots and dies, the files are still going to be there, the standard is still there, so you can, for example, implement a command line spreadsheet that can be visualized in a cloud client, a Web Browser, a Callphone, a toaster ... you get it.
This started with frustration not only with lock-in but the lack of extensability and standardazation of previous solutions.

## Studying with ilse
| What         | Explanation     | Visual |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Incremental Learning | See: Incremental Reading & Incremental Video | | 
| Incremental Reading | TODO | ![Incremental Reading](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/dev/docs/incremental-reading.svg) | 
| Incremental Video | TODO | ![Incremental Video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/dev/docs/incremental-video.svg) | 
| Spaced Repetition | TODO | ![Spaced Repetition - Forgetting Curve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/dev/docs/forgetting-curve.jpg) | 
| Interleaving | TODO | | 
| Testing |  TODO | | 
| Creation |  TODO | | 
| Ellaboration | TODO | | 

### Example 1 - Chemistry
| Step         | Explanation     | Visual |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | You import a wikipedia article on: Alcohol, and you see a table with a bunch of alcohols and how to name them: | ![Alcohols](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/dev/docs/all-alcohols.png) |
| 2 | You take screenshot of the first alcohol | ![First Alcohol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/dev/docs/alcohol.png) |
| 3 | You take screenshot of the second alcohol | ![Second Alcohol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/dev/docs/alcohol-1.png) |
| 4 | You take screenshot of the third alcohol | ![Third Alcohol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/dev/docs/alcohol-2.png) |
| 5 | You take screenshot of the Fourth alcohol | ![Fourth Alcohol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilse-langnar/notebook/dev/docs/alcohol-3.png) |
| 6 | After taking a screenshot of each item, each one of them will be "queued" differently based on your memory, thus the schedule for each item will be different based on how well you remember the alcohol, allowing you to "chunk" this knowledge about alcohols | |

### Default Color Theme
#1F1F1F
#E6E6E6
#838383
#505050
#A4A4A4

## Main Theme
We should also only use black and white, the main theme should feel like a manga or something.


## CSS
We use bulma.css as css lib and the `.columns .column.is-nth.is-offset-nth` for columns here

## Icons
All of the icons have to come from http://tabler-icons.io/ otherwiser they'll look 'misplaced'

### Adding icons
If you want to add an icon, download the icon from http://tabler-icons.io/ and then open the SVG file in a text editor end edit "stroke-width='2'" to "stroke-width='1'" and then you can add the icon

## Typeface
We normally use the "Inter" font for everything but certain elements like code snippets where we use 'Fira Code'
